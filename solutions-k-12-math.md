    comic_panels:
    - caption: Ms. Yoon’s 11th graders love to read, but they all read at very different
        levels. This can make Ms. Yoon’s job as an English teacher pretty challenging.
    - caption: 'She wants to build her students’ confidence and meet her readers where
        they are, but creating differentiated resources is too time-consuming. '
    - caption: 'When she struggles, her students struggle. It’s hard to have a class
        discussion when everyone is literally on a different page. '
    - caption: 'Then, Ms. Yoon discovers Albert’s Leveled Reading course. Now all
        of her students can read at their own level and still discuss the same ideas
        in class. '
  - title: Ms. Abdulaziz
    comic_panels:
    - caption: Ms. Abdulaziz’s 9th grade English students are mostly visual learners.
        She tries her best to make sure that she is differentiating for their needs.
    - caption: 'She has been looking for resources that visually represent simple
        English concepts, but has not been able to find any that meet her needs. '
    - caption: That’s why she loves Albert’s Elements of a Sentence course, which
        uses images in all its explanations to make grammar concepts come to life.
    - caption: Ms. Abdulaziz watches her student’s mastery soar as students connect
        abstract concepts with concrete representations. She even decorates her classroom
        with Albert’s grammar drawings!

  - title: Mr. Cohen
    comic_panels:
    - caption: 'Mr. Cohen loves teaching an interdisciplinary subject, combining English
        and Social Studies designed to turn his students into strong writers and informed
        citizens. '
    - caption: He loves the freedom of creating his own course, but with great freedom
        comes the great responsibility of creating lots of custom lesson plans...
    - caption: 'Mr. Cohen turns to Albert’s Essential Readings course, which provides
        a vast array of interdisciplinary passages and questions, including his favorite:
        foundational American texts.'
    - caption: With their daily assessments taken care of, his students are free to
        spend class time on creative projects that highlight their deep understanding
        of literature and history.

  - title: Mr. Patel
    comic_panels:
    - caption: Mr. Patel uses the 10 Common Core Anchor Standards to guide his ELA
        instruction throughout the year.
    - caption: He uses Albert’s Reading Blueprints course to easily assign mixed practice
        or isolated skill practice aligned to CC Anchor Standards.
    - caption: With over 1,000 Reading Blueprints questions, there’s no shortage of
        practice for Mr. Patel’s students -- and no shortage of data for him to analyze.
    - caption: 'The grading is instant, so Mr. Patel can spend more time understanding
        his students’ performance. '
